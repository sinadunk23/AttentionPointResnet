# Attention PointResNet: End-to-end Point Cloud Registration With AttentionResidual Connections

![pic-network](docs/pipeline_attentionv2.png)

This is the project webpage of our work AttentionPointResnet. AttentionPointResnet is a deep-learning approach designed for performing end-to-end rigid  point cloud registration for objects in a iterative fashion. ```


## Training

Run the appropriate jupyter notebooks to train the different network with any desired loss function. We use the processed ModelNet40 dataset from [PointNet](https://github.com/charlesq34/pointnet) for this work, which will be automatically downloaded if necessary.
## Pretrained models

Our pretrained models can be downloaded from [here](). You should be able to obtain the results shown in the paper by using these checkpoints.
